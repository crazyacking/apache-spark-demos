# Apache Spark Demos

This repository contains my personal example for Apache Spark.

This is just examples and not production code.

The folder *infrastructure* have Docker containers to run these examples.

To start the containers run *./infrastructure/start.sh* (and *./infrastructure/stop.sh* to stop the containers)

Use *./run-job.sh* to run a job in the docker containers, change the job in the script accordingly.
